Here's how you can use the $and, $not, $nor, and $or operators in MongoDB with a student collection:

1. $and
The $and operator is used to combine multiple conditions. It returns documents that match all the conditions.
Find students who are older than 20 and have marks greater than or equal to 90.

db.student.find({
    $and: [
        { age: { $gt: 20 } },
        { marks: { $gte: 90 } }
    ]
})

2. $not
The $not operator inverts the effect of a query expression, returning documents that do not match the query expression.
Find students who do not have a grade of "A++".
db.student.find({
    grade: { $not: { $eq: "A++" } }
})


3. $nor
The $nor operator is similar to $and, but it returns documents that fail to match both conditions.

Find students who do not have marks greater than 85 or are not older than 21.

db.student.find({
    $nor: [
        { marks: { $gt: 85 } },
        { age: { $gt: 21 } }
    ]
})

4. $or
The $or operator is used to combine multiple conditions, and it returns documents that match any of the conditions.
Find students who have marks greater than or equal to 90 or are younger than 18.

db.student.find({
    $or: [
        { marks: { $gte: 90 } },
        { age: { $lt: 18 } }
    ]
})

Element Query Operators

$exists
The $exists operator is used to check whether a specified field exists in a document.
Find students who have a grade field in their documents.

db.student.find({
    grade: { $exists: true }
})


$type
The $type operator is used to select documents where the value of a field is of a specific type.
Find students whose marks field is of type int (integer).

db.student.find({
    marks: { $type: "int" }
})



db.student.updateOne(
    { name: "Hannah" },       
    { $set: { grade: "A" } } 
)

//db.collection_name.updateMany(
    {},                  
    { $inc: { age: 1 } }
)

db.student.updateMany(
    {}, 
    { $set: { subject: "Maths" } }
)

db.student.findOneAndUpdate(
    { name: "Frank" },            
    { $set: { name: "Frank Frank" } }
    
)


db.student.replaceOne(
    { name: "Frank Frank" },    
    { name: "Frank" }            
)
